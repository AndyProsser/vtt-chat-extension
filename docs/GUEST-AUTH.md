## Overview

VTT-Chat supports two distinct invite access paths. Only one path creates guest accounts.

### Player Guest Path (extension-required)

The DM generates a per-campaign **player invite link**. Players visit that link while running the browser extension on a supported VTT (e.g. D&D Beyond). The third-party system has already authenticated the user and validated their character. The extension scrapes that validated data and hands it to the vtt-chat backend, which matches or creates a guest account and issues a session token.

This is a deliberate trust delegation model:

> "D&D Beyond has already verified that this email address owns this character in this campaign. vtt-chat trusts that assertion to skip its own registration flow."

The DM flow is **separate and distinct** from the player guest flow. DMs must hold a full vtt-chat account — the campaign is created in vtt-chat first, and the player invite code is then used in the extension popup to link the DDB campaign to the vtt-chat campaign. DMs are identified by the extension detecting that the logged-in DDB user owns the campaign, and they authenticate via password login, not guest bypass. See [DM-LINK.md](DM-LINK.md) for the complete DM identity and campaign linking specification.

**The first player to connect bootstraps the campaign character stubs** from the DM's prior campaign sync. If the DM has already run a DM sync (§5f of EXTENSION-INTEGRATION.md), stub records exist for all party members; players adopt those stubs on first login. If no DM sync has run, the first player connection creates data structures as normal.

The DM must hold a **full vtt-chat account** to generate spectator invite links, access the admin console, or run the DM campaign sync.

**Guest players are campaign-scoped.** A guest player account cannot browse or join other campaigns independently. Each additional campaign requires a separate extension-based authentication.

### Spectator Watch Path (no extension required)

The DM generates a separate **spectator invite link**. Spectators open this link in a browser — no extension required. The invite page shows campaign details, active character roster with connection status, and current session status. Spectators can either authenticate with a full account or create a temporary guest spectator account for watch-session access.

Full-account users can also find and join campaigns that advertise themselves as open to spectators via the campaign browse page — no invite link required for that path.

The DM has ultimate authority over spectator access: whether spectators are permitted, what account types are allowed, how many can be present simultaneously, and whether a waitlist is maintained.

Campaign visibility is independent from session state. Campaign cards are shown based on campaign privacy and access rules; session lifecycle only affects launch/watch actions and history availability.

### Current validation status (2026-05)

Core guest/spectator runtime validation is complete in the main repository:

- Backend guest and spectator API paths are covered for success/error/authz boundaries, including waitlist status transitions.
- External integration sync-policy and campaign external-link authorization boundaries are regression-tested.
- Frontend join/watch/browse and guest-upgrade auth transition paths are covered by deterministic component/integration tests.
- Multi-step backend integration tests now validate invite/preflight/guest-login and spectator waitlist-to-promotion journeys.

Extension-specific bridge milestones remain tracked and executed in the extension repository roadmap.

## 1. Trust Model

### 1.1 Why External Auth Is Trusted

Third-party platforms (D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry VTT) enforce their own account validation. Specifically:

- A D&D Beyond user must own or be invited to a campaign to appear on its character roster.
- Character-to-campaign membership is validated by the external platform.
- The scraped email address is the same address the user registered with on the external platform.

vtt-chat treats the combination of `(externalSystem, externalUserId, email)` as sufficient to issue a guest token, subject to the invite link being valid.

### 1.2 Scope of Trust

| What is trusted                                   | What is NOT trusted                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Email from external profile                       | Email supplied manually by the user                       |
| Character membership in campaign (by externalId)  | Campaign data that doesn't match the invite code          |
| DM status from external campaign owner field      | Role escalation beyond what the external system indicates |
| Avatar URL and display name from external profile | Arbitrary metadata injected by the extension              |

### 1.3 Canonical Relationship Model

- Campaign participation is modeled as `User -> CampaignMembership(role) -> Character`.
- A campaign membership has one active role (`DM`, `PLAYER`, or `SPECTATOR`) at a time.
- Player memberships have one active character per campaign. Character replacement is allowed.
- Chat/history records retain send-time character snapshot fields so old messages keep the original character identity.
- Spectator memberships do not own characters.

---

## 2. Invite Links and Spectator Access

There are two distinct invite link types. They are generated separately, have different flows, and serve different roles.

### 2.1 Player Invite Links (Extension Required)

Player invite links require the browser extension (or equivalent VTT integration) to authenticate.

- Player invite links can be generated by a **full-account DM or a sysadmin**. The invite is **campaign-scoped** and applies to all extension-joining users — both players and the DM.
- One active player invite code per campaign.
- Codes are opaque random strings (minimum 24 characters, URL-safe).
- The invite carries **no role information**. The DM role is inferred from the external system's campaign ownership data supplied in the extension data packet at join time.
- Invite codes can be **revoked and reissued** by a DM (any account type, once joined) or a sysadmin. Revoking prevents new connections; existing sessions continue until their token expires naturally.

```text
https://<platform>/join/<inviteCode>
https://<platform>/join/<inviteCode>?source=dndbeyond
```

The extension pre-flight validates this code before attempting guest login (see Section 3).

---

### 2.2 Spectator Invite Links (No Extension Required)

Spectator invite links open a browser page — no extension installation required.

- Only full-account DMs can generate spectator invite links.
- One active spectator invite code per campaign (separate from the player invite code).
- The spectator invite page shows: campaign name, DM display name, active character roster with connection status, and current session status (in session / between sessions).
- The user may authenticate with a full account or create a temporary guest spectator account.
- Spectators **cannot access the green room**. Spectator sessions are only active during a live session. Spectators who connect between sessions see the status page only.

```text
https://<platform>/watch/<spectatorInviteCode>
```

Response from the invite validation endpoint:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "type": "spectator",
  "campaign": {
    "name": "The Lost Mines",
    "dmDisplayName": "Gandalf",
    "sessionActive": true,
    "spectatorSlotsFilled": 2,
    "spectatorSlotsMax": 5,
    "spectatorWaitlistEnabled": true,
    "waitlistPosition": null
  },
  "characters": [
    {
      "name": "Aragorn",
      "class": "Ranger",
      "level": 5,
      "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/char.png",
      "online": true
    },
    {
      "name": "Gandalf",
      "class": "Wizard",
      "level": 20,
      "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/char2.png",
      "online": false
    }
  ]
}
```

If capacity is reached, the response indicates the waitlist position. The user can opt into the waitlist and will be auto-promoted (first-come-first-served) when a slot opens due to a spectator disconnecting (after the reconnect grace period expires).

---

### 2.3 Spectator Access Controls (DM-Controlled)

The DM sets spectator policy per campaign from Campaign Settings:

| Setting  | Label                  | Who can spectate                                                               |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NONE`   | No spectators          | Spectators are disabled. Campaign still appears in browse (marked as private). |
| `GUESTS` | Guests & full accounts | Anyone with a spectator invite can spectate (subject to capacity/waitlist).    |
| `USERS`  | Full accounts only     | Only users with full vtt-chat accounts can spectate.                           |

Additional controls:

- **Max spectators**: integer (null = platform default). Sysadmins set the platform default and a hard maximum that DMs cannot exceed.
- **Waitlist**: enabled/disabled per campaign. When enabled and at capacity, new spectators join a waitlist and are auto-promoted when a slot opens.
- **Reconnect grace period**: a disconnected spectator retains their slot for a configurable grace period (sysadmin-controlled default) before being removed and triggering a waitlist promotion.
- **Discoverable**: boolean. When true and `spectatorPolicy != NONE`, the campaign appears in the public campaign browse list for full-account users.
- **Session grandfathering rule**: if spectators are disabled mid-session, already-connected spectators keep access until that session ends. New sessions block spectator entry until spectators are re-enabled.

---

### 2.4 Campaign Browse (Full Account Users)

Full-account users can browse campaigns that are visible by campaign privacy/access rules. This does not require an invite link.

Campaigns with `spectatorPolicy = NONE` or `discoverable = false` appear in browse results as **private** (name shown, no join option).

```text
GET /api/campaigns/browse
```

Response includes:

- Campaign name, DM display name
- Session status (active / between sessions) for launch/watch context only
- Spectator slot count and availability
- Whether the campaign is private (join button disabled)

Guest player accounts cannot access the campaign browse page — they are scoped to their campaign and can only join via extension.

---

### 2.5 Player Invite Code Validation (Pre-flight)

Before attempting a player guest login, the extension validates the invite:

```text
GET /api/campaigns/invite/:code/validate
```

Response:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "type": "player",
  "campaign": {
    "name": "The Lost Mines",
    "dmDisplayName": "Gandalf"
  },
  "platformStatus": {
    "online": true,
    "activeUsers": 12,
    "activeCampaigns": 3
  }
}
```

If the code is expired or not found:

```json
{
  "valid": false,
  "reason": "INVITE_EXPIRED"
}
```

---

## 3. Pre-flight Validation (Player / Extension Path)

The pre-flight sequence below applies to the **player invite path** (extension-required). The spectator path has its own simpler flow — see Section 4.6 and 4.7.

Before presenting a join UI or requesting a token, the extension performs a pre-flight check sequence. This runs in the background script immediately after the user activates the extension on a supported page.

### 3.1 Pre-flight Steps

**Returning user (device credential stored):**

```text
1. GET /api/platform/status
2. POST /api/auth/extension/credential/exchange { credential, deviceId }
     → Success: fresh JWT obtained — skip to launch (no invite code needed)
     → CREDENTIAL_EXPIRED_FULL: prompt for password only (no invite code)
     → CREDENTIAL_INVALID / CREDENTIAL_EXPIRED_GUEST: fall back to first-time flow below
```

**First-time user (no device credential):**

```text
1. GET /api/platform/status          — Is the platform online?
2. GET /api/campaigns/invite/:code/validate  — Is the invite valid?
3. POST /api/auth/extension/preflight        — Does a vtt-chat account exist for this email?
```

Steps 1 and 2 are unauthenticated. Step 3 submits the scraped email address (and external system identifier) to check account status without issuing a token. After a successful first-time login, the `deviceCredential` returned in the response must be stored in `localStorage` so future launches use the returning-user path above.

### 3.2 Platform Status Endpoint

```text
GET /api/platform/status
```

Returns a public status snapshot used by the extension popup for display to users before they join.

Response:

```json
{
  "online": true,
  "version": "1.4.0",
  "activeUsers": 24,
  "activeCampaigns": 5,
  "activeSessions": 2,
  "maintenanceMode": false
}
```

### 3.3 Account Pre-check Endpoint

```text
POST /api/auth/extension/preflight
```

Legacy body shape (deprecated compatibility):

```json
{
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "externalSystem": "dndbeyond",
  "externalUserId": "ddb-user-12345",
  "inviteCode": "abc123..."
}
```

Response variants:

```json
// No vtt-chat account — guest flow proceeds automatically
{
  "accountStatus": "none",
  "suggestedFlow": "guest"
}

// Existing guest account — auto-login will occur
{
  "accountStatus": "guest",
  "suggestedFlow": "auto-login"
}

// Full account exists — user must authenticate
{
  "accountStatus": "full",
  "suggestedFlow": "authenticate",
  "loginHint": "player@example.com"
}

// Full account, already logged in (token in extension memory)
{
  "accountStatus": "full",
  "suggestedFlow": "already-authenticated"
}
```

The pre-check does not expose whether or not the email is registered beyond these four cases. It does not return user IDs or tokens.

### 3.4 Pre-flight UI Outcome

Based on the pre-flight results, the extension popup presents one of:

| Outcome                      | UI presented                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Platform offline             | "VTT-Chat is currently unreachable."                        |
| Invite invalid               | "This invite link is no longer valid."                      |
| Platform online, no account  | "Welcome! You'll join as a guest using your [DDB] account." |
| Existing guest account       | "Welcome back! Joining as [display name]."                  |
| Full account (not logged in) | "You have a VTT-Chat account. Please log in to continue."   |
| Full account (logged in)     | "Joining as [display name]."                                |

## 4. Authentication Flows

### 4.1 New Guest (No Existing Account)

```text
Extension scrapes identity from DDB
  → pre-flight: accountStatus = "none"
  → POST /api/auth/extension/guest-login
  → backend creates guest User record (authType = GUEST)
  → backend creates ExternalIdentity linked to user
  → backend matches or creates Character + CampaignMembership
  → JWT issued (guest token, short expiry, renewable)
  → extension stores token in memory
  → SPA opens, token injected via query param or postMessage
```

### 4.2 Returning Guest (Existing Guest Account)

```text
Extension scrapes identity from DDB
  → pre-flight: accountStatus = "guest"
  → POST /api/auth/extension/guest-login (same endpoint)
  → backend finds existing user by (email + externalSystem)
  → backend updates user profile fields from scraped data (if sync policy allows)
  → backend updates character fields from scraped data (if sync policy allows)
  → JWT issued
```

### 4.3 Existing Full Account (Not Logged In)

```text
Extension scrapes identity from DDB
  → pre-flight: accountStatus = "full"
  → extension popup shows login form (email pre-filled)
  → user enters password
  → POST /api/auth/login (standard auth endpoint)
  → on success: campaign membership created if not already present
  → JWT issued
```

### 4.4 Existing Full Account (Already Logged In)

```text
Extension has valid JWT in memory
  → pre-flight: accountStatus = "full", suggestedFlow = "already-authenticated"
  → POST /api/campaigns/invite/:code/join (authenticated)
  → campaign membership created if not already present
  → existing session resumes or new session context set
```

### 4.5 Campaign Bootstrap (First User Connects)

The first user to join a campaign via the player invite — whether a player or the DM — bootstraps the campaign's data structures. The extension sends a **campaign data packet** alongside the individual's identity data.

The campaign data packet contains:

- External DM ID (used to determine who holds the DM role)
- List of all campaign members: external user IDs, display names, and basic character info (name, class, level, external character ID) as known to the external system at that moment
- External campaign ID and campaign name

On receiving the first connection for a campaign:

1. Backend creates the Campaign record (linked to the external campaign via `CampaignExternalLink`).
2. Backend creates stub records for all members listed in the packet (User stubs, Character stubs, CampaignMembership records).
3. The connecting user's stub is promoted to a full session participant — their token is issued.
4. **Role is assigned**: if the connecting user's external ID matches the DM ID in the packet, they receive the DM table role; otherwise they receive the Player role.

When subsequent users connect:

- Their stub record already exists; the backend updates it with the live extension data.
- Their role is assigned by the same rule (external user ID vs DM ID in the packet).
- Character and campaign data is updated per the campaign's `extensionSyncPolicy`.

When the DM connects (if not the first user):

- They receive the DM table role automatically.
- Session controls (start/stop/pause) become available immediately.
- No manual handoff or re-join is required.

---

### 4.6 Spectator Watch Join (Via Spectator Invite Link)

No extension required.

```text
User opens https://<platform>/watch/<spectatorInviteCode>
  → browser loads the spectator invite page
  → page shows: campaign info, character roster + connection status, session status, slot availability
  → if spectatorPolicy = USERS: redirect to standard login
  → if spectatorPolicy = NONE: show "Spectators not enabled" message
  → if at capacity and waitlist disabled: show "Session full" message
  → if at capacity and waitlist enabled: offer waitlist opt-in
  → if unauthenticated: user may continue as guest spectator or log in/register
  → if guest path selected: POST /api/auth/spectator/guest-join
  → backend creates guest spectator user + spectator campaign membership
  → if slot available: token issued, user enters session view
  → if on waitlist: polling/push notification; promoted automatically when slot opens
  → on promotion: token issued, user enters session view
```

Spectator guest endpoint:

```text
POST /api/auth/spectator/guest-join
```

This endpoint is the canonical guest spectator onboarding path for direct watch links.

Body:

```json
{
  "spectatorInviteCode": "xyz789...",
  "displayName": "DragonFan42",
  "email": "fan@example.com"
}
```

Legacy response (slot available):

```json
{
  "token": "jwt-spectator-token",
  "user": { "id": "uuid", "displayName": "DragonFan42", "authType": "GUEST" },
  "campaignId": "uuid",
  "status": "active"
}
```

Legacy response (waitlisted):

```json
{
  "token": null,
  "campaignId": "uuid",
  "status": "waitlisted",
  "waitlistPosition": 3,
  "waitlistToken": "opaque-poll-token"
}
```

The `waitlistToken` is used to poll `GET /api/campaigns/:id/spectator/waitlist-status` until promoted.

---

### 4.7 Full Account Spectator

Full-account users may spectate via invite link or via the campaign browse page.

**Via invite link:**

```text
User opens https://<platform>/watch/<spectatorInviteCode>
  → if already logged in: proceed to slot check → enter session view
  → if not logged in: login prompt → on success: slot check → enter session view
```

**Via campaign browse:**

```text
Full-account user navigates to /browse
  → lists active discoverable campaigns with spectator slots
  → user clicks a campaign
  → slot check: if available → enter session view
  → if at capacity + waitlist enabled → offer waitlist
  → if spectatorPolicy = USERS: proceed
  → if spectatorPolicy = GUESTS: proceed
  → if spectatorPolicy = NONE: campaign shown as private, no join option
```

Full-account spectators are subject to the same max-slot and waitlist rules as guest spectators.

---

### 4.8 Spectator Session Constraints

Regardless of account type:

- Spectators **cannot access the green room**.
- Spectators cannot send chat messages, whispers, or notes.
- Spectators can adjust local audio mix only (client-local), and cannot change room/global audio state.
- Spectators can see the character roster, presence indicators, and in-session chat (read-only).
- Private chats are always hidden from spectators.
- If the session ends, the spectator view shows a "Session ended" state and the spectator's slot is released.
- A disconnected spectator retains their slot for the reconnect grace period (sysadmin-controlled, default recommended: 60 seconds). After expiry the slot is released and the next waitlist entry is promoted.

---

### 4.9 Guest Login Endpoint (Player / DM)

```text
POST /api/auth/extension/guest-login
```

Used by both players and DMs. Role is determined server-side from the `campaignPacket.dmExternalUserId` field.

Policy lock note (2026-05-04): DM/Player guest access is granted only through this extension POST invite flow. Resulting guest access is campaign-scoped and can later be upgraded to a full account. Outside extension launch, DM/Player guest access is not granted.

Body:

```json
{
  "inviteCode": "abc123...",
  "externalSystem": "dndbeyond",
  "externalUserId": "ddb-user-12345",
  "email": "player@example.com",
  "displayName": "Aragorn's Player",
  "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/player.png",
  "character": {
    "name": "Aragorn",
    "race": "Human",
    "class": "Ranger",
    "subclass": "Hunter",
    "level": 5,
    "externalCharacterId": "ddb-char-67890",
    "characterUrl": "https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/67890",
    "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/char.png"
  },
  "campaignPacket": {
    "externalCampaignId": "ddb-campaign-11111",
    "campaignName": "The Lost Mines of Phandelver",
    "dmExternalUserId": "ddb-user-99999",
    "members": [
      {
        "externalUserId": "ddb-user-12345",
        "displayName": "Aragorn's Player",
        "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/player.png",
        "character": {
          "externalCharacterId": "ddb-char-67890",
          "name": "Aragorn",
          "class": "Ranger",
          "level": 5,
          "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/char.png"
        }
      },
      {
        "externalUserId": "ddb-user-22222",
        "displayName": "Legolas's Player",
        "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/player2.png",
        "character": {
          "externalCharacterId": "ddb-char-33333",
          "name": "Legolas",
          "class": "Fighter",
          "level": 5,
          "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/char2.png"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The `campaignPacket` field is required on the **first connection** for a campaign (when no `CampaignExternalLink` exists for the invite code's campaign). On subsequent connections it is optional; if provided, it is used to update stubs per the `extensionSyncPolicy`.

Response:

```json
{
  "token": "jwt-guest-token",
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "displayName": "Aragorn's Player",
    "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/player.png",
    "authType": "GUEST",
    "campaignId": "uuid",
    "role": "Player"
  },
  "character": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "Aragorn",
    "avatarUrl": "https://ddb.ac/avatars/char.png"
  },
  "campaignBootstrapped": false,
  "deviceCredential": {
    "credential": "opaque-base64url-string",
    "deviceId": "uuid-sent-in-request"
  }
}
```

`role` is `"DM"` or `"Player"` as determined by the server. `campaignBootstrapped` is `true` only when this connection created the campaign data structures for the first time.

`deviceCredential` is present only when the request included a `deviceId`. The extension must store it in `localStorage` keyed by `player:<externalCampaignId>:<externalSystem>` alongside the vtt-chat `campaignId` from `user.campaignId`. See [DEVICE-CREDENTIALS.md](DEVICE-CREDENTIALS.md) for the full storage contract and reconnect flows.

### 4.10 Returning User via Device Credential

The normal path for any user who has previously joined a campaign via the extension. No invite code is needed; the stored `deviceCredential` is the sole reconnection mechanism.

```text
Extension holds deviceCredential in localStorage
  → POST /api/auth/extension/credential/exchange { credential, deviceId }
  → Backend validates credential, returns { token, credential } (credential is rotated)
  → Extension stores the new credential immediately (old one is now invalid)
  → POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/session/ensure
       → if no IDLE session exists: creates one (any campaign member may do this, including guests)
       → if any session exists (IDLE, ACTIVE, PAUSED, COOLDOWN): returns it unchanged
       → returns { sessionId, sessionState, campaignDisplayState }
  → Branch by account type:
       GUEST → open /ext-launch?campaignId=<uuid>&token=<jwt>&sessionId=<id>
               (auto-login, no password prompt)
       FULL (JWT valid in memory) → open /ext-launch?campaignId=<uuid>&token=<jwt>&sessionId=<id>
               (auto-login, no password prompt)
       FULL (JWT absent or expired) → open /ext-launch?campaignId=<uuid>&sessionId=<id>&hint=<email>
               (single password field shown; email pre-filled and read-only)
```

**GREENROOM session creation by non-DM users:**

`POST /api/campaigns/:campaignId/session/ensure` accepts any valid extension-credential JWT, regardless of the caller's campaign role. If no session exists for the campaign, the backend creates one in the `IDLE` state. This is the only case where a player or guest may create a session — DM session controls (`ACTIVE`, `PAUSED`, etc.) still require the DM role. The DM may start the session normally once connected; players enter the GREENROOM until then.

## 5. External Identity Tracking

### 5.1 ExternalIdentity Record

Every user authenticated via an external system has an `ExternalIdentity` record:

```text
ExternalIdentity
  id              — internal UUID
  userId          — FK to User
  externalSystem  — enum: DNDBEYOND | ROLL20 | FOUNDRY | ...
  externalUserId  — string (system-specific user identifier)
  email           — string (scraped from external profile)
  lastSeenAt      — timestamp
  createdAt       — timestamp
```

One user may have multiple `ExternalIdentity` records (one per system they've connected through). The `email` is the linking key — if the same email address appears from a different external system, it resolves to the same vtt-chat user.

### 5.2 Character External IDs

Characters may be associated with an external character record:

```text
Character
  ...
  externalSystem    — enum (nullable)
  externalId        — string (nullable)
  characterUrl      — string (nullable)
```

When a character is created or updated via the extension, these fields are populated. They are used to:

- Detect updates when the same character reconnects in a later session.
- Prevent duplicate character records for the same external character.

### 5.3 Campaign External IDs

A campaign may be linked to a campaign on an external system:

```text
CampaignExternalLink
  id              — internal UUID
  campaignId      — FK to Campaign
  externalSystem  — enum
  externalId      — string (e.g. DDB campaign ID)
  linkedAt        — timestamp
  linkedBy        — FK to User (who linked it, must be DM)
```

Multiple campaigns on the platform can link to the same external campaign (e.g. one DDB campaign might have a staging and a live vtt-chat campaign). However, within a single vtt-chat campaign, each external system may only have one active link at a time.

## 6. Data Sync and Override Policy

The DM controls whether data pushed from the extension can override campaign information.

### 6.1 Sync Policy Options

| Setting          | Label        | Behavior                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NONE`           | No Updates   | Extension data is used for initial setup only. No updates after first login.          |
| `DM_ONLY`        | DM-only      | Only data pushed by the DM's extension session can update campaign/character records. |
| `DM_AND_PLAYERS` | DM & Players | Any connected user's extension data may trigger updates.                              |

The policy is stored per campaign:

```text
Campaign
  extensionSyncPolicy  — enum: NONE | DM_ONLY | DM_AND_PLAYERS
```

Default: `DM_ONLY`.

### 6.2 What Can Be Synced

| Data field                     | Can be synced                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| User display name              | Yes (always, user owns this)   |
| User avatar                    | Yes (always, user owns this)   |
| Character name                 | Per sync policy                |
| Character class / race / level | Per sync policy                |
| Character avatar               | Per sync policy                |
| Campaign name                  | DM-only (regardless of policy) |
| Campaign player list           | DM-only (regardless of policy) |

DM-level campaign data (name, structure) can only be updated when the push comes from a user with DM membership in the campaign, regardless of the extensionSyncPolicy.

### 6.3 Sync Update Endpoint

```text
POST /api/integrations/external/sync
```

Requires authentication (guest or full token). Validates the caller's campaign membership and role before applying any updates.

Body:

```json
{
  "campaignId": "uuid",
  "externalSystem": "dndbeyond",
  "source": "player",
  "characterUpdate": {
    "externalCharacterId": "ddb-char-67890",
    "level": 6,
    "class": "Ranger",
    "subclass": "Gloom Stalker"
  },
  "campaignUpdate": null
}
```

The server applies the update only if the sync policy permits it for the caller's role.

---

## 7. Account Upgrade (Guest → Full)

### 7.1 UI Prompt

Guest users are shown a persistent but dismissible upgrade prompt in the platform UI. This is rendered as an info banner in the app header and optionally in the user profile panel.

The prompt is not shown during active session play to avoid disruption.

### 7.2 Upgrade Flow (Player or DM Guest)

```text
Guest user clicks "Upgrade to full account"
  → UI presents email (pre-filled, read-only) and password fields
  → POST /api/auth/upgrade
  → backend validates email matches guest account
  → backend sets authType = FULL, stores passwordHash
  → JWT reissued with full account claims
  → guest token invalidated
```

Endpoint:

```text
POST /api/auth/upgrade
```

Requires valid guest token.

Body:

```json
{
  "password": "new-secure-password"
}
```

Response: new JWT + updated user record.

### 7.3 Spectator → Player / DM Account Transition

Spectators are not extension users. A spectator (guest or full account) who later uses a valid player invite in the extension can transition to player access when the account identity can be safely linked.

**Path A — Full-account spectator uses player invite:**

```text
Spectator opens a player invite link in the extension
  → extension runs preflight and guest-login flow as normal
  → backend finds existing authenticated user context
  → campaign membership role changes from SPECTATOR to PLAYER (or DM if external ownership matches)
  → transition is immediate and launch proceeds
```

**Path B — Guest spectator upgrades through extension player invite:**

```text
Guest spectator opens player invite in extension
  → backend links by safe email/system match rules
  → campaign membership role is set to PLAYER (or DM if external ownership matches)
  → launch proceeds without extra registration prompts
```

In both paths the user's vtt-chat UUID is preserved and campaign/session history is retained.

### 7.4 Data Continuity

All campaign memberships, characters, chat history, notes, and session history are preserved across the upgrade. The user's vtt-chat UUID does not change.

---

## 8. Security Considerations

### 8.1 Guest Token Scope

Guest JWTs carry:

- `authType: GUEST`
- A reduced token lifetime (e.g. 24 hours vs 30 days for full accounts)
- Renewable via the extension while the extension is active (silent renewal, no prompt)

Guest tokens are subject to the same WS:AUTH validation as full tokens.

### 8.2 Email Trust Boundary

The platform trusts the scraped email address only within the context of a valid invite code and an authorized external system. If:

- The invite code is invalid → request rejected.
- The external system is not authorized → request rejected.
- The email does not match an existing account on extension POST guest-login → guest account created (not merged with any existing full account without explicit user confirmation).

### 8.3 No Credential Exposure

Guest login does not expose passwords. Guest accounts do not have passwords. The extension never transmits vtt-chat credentials; it only transmits data scraped from the external platform.

### 8.4 Token Storage

**JWT (short-lived session token):** stored in background script memory only. It is never written to `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, `chrome.storage`, or cookies. It is lost when the browser is closed or the extension is unloaded.

**Device credential (long-lived reconnect token):** stored in `localStorage`. It survives browser restarts and is the sole mechanism for reconnecting without re-entering an invite code. See [DEVICE-CREDENTIALS.md](DEVICE-CREDENTIALS.md) for the full storage key convention and exchange flow.

This two-tier model means invite codes are used once and discarded; the extension does not store them.

---

## 9. DM Workflow

### 9.1 DM Account Requirement

**DMs must hold a full vtt-chat account.** The campaign is created in vtt-chat before the extension is involved, so the DM necessarily has a full account by the time they need to link via the extension.

The extension launch path for DMs is separate from the player guest path — it requires a full account password login and uses `POST /api/auth/extension/dm-link` to bind the DM's DDB identity to their vtt-chat account. Guest tokens are rejected by that endpoint and by `POST /api/integrations/external/dm-sync`.

> Full specification of the DM identity and campaign linking flow, including guest account merge and the extension changes required, is in **[DM-LINK.md](DM-LINK.md)**.

The player guest path (`POST /api/auth/extension/guest-login`) remains unchanged and is **players only**. The extension must never route a detected DM through the guest-login endpoint.

### 9.2 Generating a Player Invite Link

Player invite codes cover both players and the DM — no separate DM invite is needed. Players connect as guests; the DM connects via the full-account DM link flow (see [DM-LINK.md §4](DM-LINK.md)).

**To generate a player invite (via the vtt-chat UI):**

1. A full-account DM or sysadmin creates the campaign (or opens an existing one) in vtt-chat.
2. Navigate to Campaign Settings → Invites → Player Invite.
3. Click "Generate Player Invite Link".
4. Share the code with players (e.g. paste in Discord or on the DDB campaign page).
5. Share the same code with yourself (the DM) — you will enter it in the extension popup on the DDB campaign page to establish the campaign link.
6. Players connect as guests via the existing guest-login flow. The DM connects via the DM link flow using the same invite code.

**Sysadmin-issued invite (alternative flow):**

1. Sysadmin creates the campaign record and generates the player invite code from the admin panel.
2. Invite code is shared with the DM and players.
3. The first person to connect bootstraps the campaign data structures (see Section 4.5).

**Revoke and reissue:**

- A DM (any account type) or sysadmin may revoke and reissue the player invite code at any time.
- Revoking prevents new connections; the extension will fail to authenticate with the revoked code.
- Reissuing generates a new code; the old code is invalidated immediately.
- One active player invite code per campaign.

### 9.3 Generating a Spectator Invite Link

1. Navigate to Campaign Settings → Invites → Spectator Invite.
2. Ensure `spectatorPolicy` is not `NONE`.
3. Click "Generate Spectator Invite Link".
4. Share with spectators — no extension required. Clicking the link opens the spectator invite page.

- One active spectator invite code per campaign.
- DM may regenerate or disable at any time.
- If `spectatorPolicy = USERS`, the invite page will require the visitor to log in with a full account.
- If `spectatorPolicy = NONE`, the invite link will show a "Spectators not enabled" message.

### 9.4 Spectator Access Controls

From Campaign Settings → Spectators:

| Control          | Options                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Who can spectate | None / Guests & Full Accounts / Full Accounts Only            |
| Max spectators   | Integer (1–[sysadmin max], or platform default if left blank) |
| Waitlist         | Enabled / Disabled                                            |
| Discoverable     | Yes / No (whether campaign appears in the browse list)        |

Changing `spectatorPolicy` to `NONE` blocks new spectator joins immediately. Spectators already connected in the current session remain until that session ends.
Reducing `spectatorMax` below the current active count drops the most recently joined spectators first.

### 9.4.1 Screened Late-Join Handling (Players)

When campaign late-join mode is `SCREENED`:

- Brand-new player joins are allowed only during the configured grace window after session start.
- After the grace window expires, the join API rejects new player joins with a DM-screening message.
- DMs and previously joined reconnecting players continue to bypass the late-join gate.
- A dedicated pending late-join screening queue is not part of the current Phase 1 implementation.

### 9.5 Invite Link Lifecycle

- Player and spectator invite codes are separate and managed independently.
- **Player invite codes** can be revoked and reissued by a DM (any account type) or a sysadmin.
- **Spectator invite codes** can only be generated and managed by a full-account DM.
- Revoking an invite (setting `active = false`) prevents new joins but does not drop existing members.
- When a code is reissued, the previous code is invalidated immediately. Extensions holding the old code will fail token renewal and the user will need to reconnect with the new link.
- A sysadmin can revoke either invite type for any campaign.

### 9.6 Monitoring Linked Identities and Spectators

Campaign Settings shows the DM:

- Which external systems are linked to the campaign.
- Which users joined via extension vs. standard registration vs. spectator invite.
- Current extensionSyncPolicy and controls to change it.
- List of external identities per member.
- Active spectator list with slot count, connection status, and waitlist queue.
